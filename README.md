# Egg Timer

## Goal

The goal of creating this project is to get myself comfortable with creating and working with things that I have never done before and get myself accomodated with the process of referring documentation and StackOverflow for help.

## What did I create

I created a beautiful egg timer app to boil eggs to perfection depending on how one prefers their eggs.

## What did I learn

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Conditional statements - Switch
* Functions with outputs
* How to use the ProgressView

>The project is part of **iOS Development Bootcamp** on **UDEMY** by **Angela Yu**. Check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/)
